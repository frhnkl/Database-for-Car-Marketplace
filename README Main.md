# Database-for-Car-Marketplace
To learn more about SQL and relational databases, we can create a project to practice. In this project, you are given the task of building a relational database for a website that offers used car sales. The general description of this project is that anyone can offer their products (used cars) in the form of advertisements and potential buyers can search based on several categories. the client determines several parameters that we must comply with in creating a database which includes:

1. a user can sell more than one car but must first fulfil personal data (user's name, contact, domicile).
2. Users can advertise cars for sale provided that the ad must have car information (make, model, type, transmission, year, etc.) and contact the seller.
3. Each user can search for the offered car based on the seller's user location, car brand, and car body type.
4. There is a bid feature for users who allow "bids" on the cars they sell.
5. transactions are made outside the web so that they are not included in the scope of work

i've created this database so we can learn SQL together. This DB can also be used as a simple Car Marketplace database if needed (whith slight changes)
